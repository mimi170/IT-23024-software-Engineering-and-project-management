1) When to Use Interface vs Abstract Class — Story + Code Explanation
Story: “The Robot World”

In a futuristic world called RoboLand, robots are created for different purposes: delivery, security, cleaning, etc.

There were two important systems for making a robot:

A) Interface → The Rule Book (Contract)

Every robot had to follow a strict rule book called RoboRules.

The rule book did not contain any implementation.
It only said:

“Every robot MUST implement these actions.”

✔ Interfaces define what must be done, not how to do it.

B) Abstract Class → The Half-Built Robot Model

There was also a blueprint called RoboModel.

Some behaviors were already implemented (like charging).

Some behaviors must be implemented by the child robot (like movement).

✔ Abstract classes give partial implementation.
